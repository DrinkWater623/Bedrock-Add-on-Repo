# DW623's Bedrock Add-Ons

### Overview
This repository contains a small amount of my development work as I've learned to navigate Bedrock Add-ons.  I am mainly creating these to use on my own server and realms.  This is my 1st Repo, and yeah, don't quite know what I am doing... But I am learning to navigate the Repo World!!

### Organization
Builds - Fully usable copies of RP/BP folders as well as the McAddOn.  There will be a readme.  Not everything is fully tested, so read the notes

Script Library - This is where I keep the common code that I copy to the different projects as needed.  I try to keep it updated when I make needed changes or additions when working on a project.

Workspace - This holds all the files for a project, minus the .regolith folder.  See the ReadMe inside Workspace Folder for more information.
