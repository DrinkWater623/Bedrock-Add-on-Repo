# DW623's Bedrock Add-Ons

## Overview
This repository contains a small amount of my development work as I've learned to navigate Bedrock Add-ons.  I am mainly creating these to use on my own server and realms.  This is my 1st Repo, and yeah, don't quite know what I am doing....

## Tools and Organization
The raw files are written for use with Regolith, the JSON Templating Filter (jsonte) and my own Filter called Mani-Fest. I do not have official documentation for it, but a copy of it is with each addon and you can see how to use it from the config.json files.  That said, hit me up if you have questions before I am able to make something for it.  Note: I have not added any thing for scripting to it's abilities.

If I have released the .mcaddon to my world for use or testing, there will be a copy of it in a release folder and you can crack that open to examine the full add-on.  Otherwise, go Regolith/Jsonte or go home.  You can learn about or get Regolith at their Hub https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS
