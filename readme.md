# DW623's Bedrock Add-Ons

### Overview
This repository contains a small amount of my development work as I've learned to navigate Bedrock Add-ons.  I am mainly creating these to use on my own server and realms.  This is my 1st Repo, and yeah, don't quite know what I am doing... But I am learning to navigate the Repo World!!

### Tools and Organization
The raw files are written for use with Regolith, the JSON Templating Filter (jsonte) and my a few of my own Filters. I do not have official documentation for them, but not hard to figure out from the config.json files.  That said, hit me up if you have questions before I am able to make something for it.  Note: I have not added any thing for scripting to mani-fest's abilities.  I will when I start to do JS.

If I have released the .mcaddon to my world for use or testing, there will be a copy of it in a release folder of that add-on and you can crack that open to examine the full add-on.  Otherwise, go Regolith/Jsonte or go home.  You can learn about or get Regolith at their Hub (see links below)
