## The Plan...

Version:
1 - Vanilla Slabs

    To-Do
        a) Add sound - dep on what side is up? if diff... not sure
        b) Add destroy time and make (a+b)/2
        c) Add correct fire resistance avg
        d) Finalize all abbreviations - will be permanent once pack is live

Maintain as new blocks come out

2 - Able to make using blocks, so can include other blocks
    But this will dramatically increase the number of blocks
    So that permutation limit, needs to be thought about 64k
