Everything is regolith style, so cannot just take and use.... 
unless you use Regolith to compile addons, and have the jsonte filter

and

Everything here is a work in progress unless it has a solid, 
well written readme.md file and a mcaddon/mcpack file in it... 

and

Everything in this folder is pre HCF removal and pre-scripting, so not current.

use at your own risk
