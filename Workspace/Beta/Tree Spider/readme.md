## Friendly Tree Spider

50% done - still major work in progress on behaviors

Idea: A nice spider who is just making webs around trees and lanterns
as an early game source of string (so don't have to keep killing cats).

And because I wanted to make a craft-able sponge, where webs are part of the recipe.
