### Known Issues
- All cut copper slabs of any type, you will need to sneak to other normal events that are not axe & wax related
- I did not add the ability to create the double slab from interacting/placing same slab.  You will have to break slab and place it horizontally to create the double slab.  I may add it one day.

### Geek Notes
- Vertical versions of the slab should be hidden.  Once broken, loot is vanilla slab
- Slab data retrieved from blocks.json using a regolith filter that processes the data.  That program is constantly being improved so I can use it for multiple things.  Viewing is available within the workspace files of my GitHub
- I spent too many hours analyzing the item destroy speeds.  From the wiki and my testing of hand-speed comparisons, I think I am on to something.  Will discuss on BAO.

### Enjoy
