## Every Vanilla Slab Combo - from slabs defined in blocks.json

Sometimes, ya just gotta have more choices when building your dream home...

This is very vanilla-ish.  I may add better placement depending on where touched on a block-face later, but as of now (1.21.50), custom components beforePlacement does not give the face-location as they do in the normal before event for player placing a block.  I'd rather use the custom component, so gonna stick it out and maybe complain.  Besides every position is doable, just have to place a temp block sometimes.

### Technical Notes:  
No, I did not make almost 2k block files and double that of recipes files.  A big shout out to creators of Regolith and the JSON templeting filter.... Make my creator life easy-peasy!  But I did have to make my own filter that get's info from the vanilla files blocks.json for the jsonte filter to use to create all those files.  Where there is a will, there is a way!
