I need help with creating a function or class or whatever for this problem

1. There are six sides to a block in minecraft.  north, south, east, west, up and down.  For NSEW, I know what block face I am dealing with.
2. I know where on the block the player has interacted with.  I have it broken down to a 3x3 grid, with 0,0 being the lower right corner, no matter what side you are dealing with. 
3. When a player touches the left side (x=2 and y=1)  or the right side (x=0 and y=1), I want to say which directional edge they are touching.  If they are touching x=0 and y=0, then it is down-east, whereas x=1 and y=2 is just up.
For example on the south side of the block, the left side is west and the right side is east.  Each side is different.

What can you come up with, in JS, that can take the face (north, south, east, west only) and the x,y coordinates, and return the name for what it represents.
Let me know if you need more info.
