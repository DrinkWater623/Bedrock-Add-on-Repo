### Overview
This folder contains the working stage files (minus the .regolith folder) for each project I have confidence in sharing. It works for me.

### Tools
The raw files are written for use with Regolith, the JSON Templating Filter (jsonte) and my a few of my own Filters. I do not have official documentation for them, but not hard to figure out from the config.json files.  That said, hit me up if you have questions before I am able to make something for it.  

If I have released the .mcaddon, it will be in the Builds Folder along with the BP/RP folders.  To use the Workspaces, you will need to install Regolith and the Jsonte Filter and be using VSCode.  My Regolith Filters are located in the filters folder within each project.   You can learn about or get Regolith at their Hub (see links below).  I suggest joining the Discord.  Once you know how to use it, it is a game-changer!
