### About
This pack has 4 auto-sifters that range in speed.  Each has to be made.  There is a demo on my youtube channel.  But basically a full block of the metal into the stone grinder makes the grates that you attach to a composter via the crafting table.

Copper, Iron, Diamond, Netherite.

It will sift sand, gravel, powdered snow, snow, mud, soul sand and concrete powder.  The mud and soul sand will naturally go much slower.

An added bonus is that you can apply water to the concrete powder at the different heights to make different size slabs, which are placable on any block face and can be combined.  You can also get different heights of the sifted material if you break the sifter under it at the desired level.

### Enjoy
