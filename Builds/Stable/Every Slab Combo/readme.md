## Every Vanilla Slab Combo - from slabs defined in blocks.json
See readme outside of this folder for license info.

Sometimes, ya just gotta have more choices when building your dream home...  I consider this a builder's dream.

This is very vanilla-ish and does not use any scripting.  It is not very early game usable.  You need to kill some slimes in order to get the glue.  I may add in something for the new resin, but for now, slimes it is.

<b>Technical Notes:</b>
I may add better placement depending on where touched on a block-face later, but as of now (1.21.50), custom components beforePlacement does not give the face-location property as they do in the normal before event for player placing a block.  I'd rather use the custom component, so gonna stick it out and maybe complain.  Besides every position is doable, just have to place a temp block sometimes.
  
No, I did not make 1955 block files and double that of recipes files.  A big shout out to creators of Regolith and the JSON templating filter.... Makes my creator life easy-peasy!  But I did have to make my own filter that get's info from the vanilla files blocks.json for the jsonte filter to use to create all those files.  Where there is a will, there is a way!

See my GitHub Profile Fan-Girl-Links section for info on Regolith and Jsonte.

Enjoy!
