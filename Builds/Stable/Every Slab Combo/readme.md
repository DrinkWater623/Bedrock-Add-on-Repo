### About
Sometimes, ya just gotta have more choices when building your dream home...  I consider this a builder's dream.  Some of the combinations are too perfect together.

This is very vanilla-ish and does not use any scripting.  It is not very early game usable.  You need to kill some slimes in order to get the glue and get some iron to make the stone grinder.  I may add in something for the new resin, but for now, slimes it is.

###Technical Notes:
I may add better placement depending on where touched on a block-face later, but as of now (1.21.50), custom components beforePlacement does not give the face-location property as they do in the normal before event for player placing a block.  I'd rather use the custom component, so gonna stick it out and maybe complain.  Besides every position is doable, just have to place a temp block sometimes.
  
No, I did not make 1955 block files and double that of recipes files.  A big shout out to creators of Regolith and the JSON templating filter.... Makes my creator life easy-peasy!  But I did have to make my own filter that get's info from the vanilla files blocks.json for the jsonte filter to use to create all those files.  Where there is a will, there is a way!

See my GitHub Profile Fan-Girl-Links section for info on Regolith and Jsonte.

Enjoy!
