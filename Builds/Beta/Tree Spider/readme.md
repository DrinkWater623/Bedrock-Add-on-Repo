### About
Cute little tree spiders spawn, mostly, in forest and live a little life of wandering and building 
webs.

I made this because sometimes I cannot wait until I find a dungeon or mine shaft in order to get webs.  I tried not to make them be overwhelming, but if you AFK in a forest, ya gonna get a lot of webs eventually.

### Enjoy
